# Commentary:
#
# Site-specific customization for Guix.
#
# The program below honors the GUIX_PYTHONPATH environment variable to
# discover Python packages.  File names appearing in this variable that match
# a predefined versioned installation prefix are added to the sys.path.  To be
# considered, a Python package must be installed under the
# 'lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages' directory, where X and Y are the major and
# minor version numbers of the Python interpreter.
#
# Code:

major_minor = '{}.{}'.format(*sys.version_info)
site_packages_prefix = os.path.join(
    'lib', 'python' + major_minor, 'site-packages')
python_site = os.path.join(sys.prefix, site_packages_prefix)

try:
    all_sites_raw = os.environ['GUIX_PYTHONPATH'].split(os.path.pathsep)

# Normalize paths, otherwise a trailing slash would cause it to not match.

matching_sites = [p for p in all_sites_norm
                  if p.endswith(site_packages_prefix)]

# Insert sites matching the current version into sys.path, right before
# Python's own site.  This way, the user can override the libraries provided
# by Python itself.
